/**
 * A pointer that moves the way a hand does, and a keyboard that types at a
 * speed a person could.
 *
 * Playwright's own input is built for tests, where the only virtue is arriving
 * instantly: `mouse.move(x, y, { steps: 20 })` dispatches twenty events as
 * fast as the transport allows, which is one frame of video. Film that and the
 * pointer teleports. So every move here is a tween the *studio* paces — an
 * eased path sampled at the capture rate, each sample a real CDP mouse event,
 * each spaced by a real wait. Hover states, drag thresholds and pointer
 * capture all behave exactly as they do for a person, because as far as the
 * page is concerned this is a person.
 *
 * The easing is smootherstep rather than a cubic, which is the closest cheap
 * approximation of how a hand actually crosses a screen: no instantaneous
 * change in acceleration at either end, so the pointer neither jumps into
 * motion nor slams into its target.
 *
 * Nothing here is random. A demo that regenerates differently every run is a
 * demo whose diff nobody can read, so the one human-looking irregularity —
 * the wobble in typing speed — is a function of the character's index.
