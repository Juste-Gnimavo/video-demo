/**
 * What a scene is, and why one script produces both kinds of asset.
 *
 * The temptation is to write the screenshots and the clips separately, and it
 * is a trap: two scripts drift, and the still on the website stops being a
 * frame of the video beside it. So a scene is written once, as a piece of
 * choreography, and it is filmed. Wherever it wants a still it says so, and
 * the recorder lifts for the moment it takes to hide the cursor and shoot —
 * see `Recorder.pause`. One script, one run, both outputs, and the still is
 * by construction a moment the film actually passes through.
 *
 * A scene is a Playwright test, which is not laziness either: the runner
 * brings the dev server up, tears a browser context down cleanly, retries a
 * scene that lost a race, and gives `--grep` for free as the scene selector.
 * What it must not bring is its own idea of artifacts, which is why the
 * config switches its screenshots and videos off and this file writes
 * everything itself.
