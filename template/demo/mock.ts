/**
 * Every request the app makes during a film, answered in this process.
 *
 * There is no API, no database and no third party behind a demo run — only
 * `page.route` handlers and whatever this file keeps in memory for the
 * length of a scene. See references/mocking.md for the two reasons this
 * matters (a corpus gets published; a demo has to be reproducible) and for
 * the route-ordering trap the comment below exists to prevent.
 *
 * Unlike `demo.config.ts`, this file is only ever evaluated by the test
 * runner, which is the whole reason the config reaches it through a dynamic
 * `import('./mock.ts')`. So it may import anything Playwright can load —
 * your app's packages, an e2e fixture, a workspace module with extensionless
 * specifiers — none of which plain Node's resolver would follow.

 * mocks a write; it doesn't. The panel that just sent the request reads its
 * own state back a moment later, and if the write went nowhere, that read
 * hands back the old value — the viewer's own change appears to undo itself
 * on film. `createStore` exists so a route handler can actually mutate
 * something and have every later read agree with it.
